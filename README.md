Abstract
------------------
Android phones are widely used due to its features like GPS, Computational ability, internet
connectivity. There are many web applications which help to user in order to provide solutions
to many problems related to their day to day life. Road accidents are the major problems in urban
areas. Also due to the delay in reaching of the ambulance to the accident place increases the
chances of the death of victim. So, in order to provide solution for this problem, we built a web
application that allows a passer by or victim to report an accident which creates a list of accidents
in a place which in turn can be accessed by the nearby hospitals allowing the nearest hospital to
take an action and provide the victim with the required medical treatment. We define one user
defined algorithm for reporting and listing accidents. While adding the accident the user enters
his/her location details which then are pinned in the google maps. At the time of registration,
application takes personal information like blood group, name, email etc. If an accident trigger
occurred, then this information will be accessed by the emergency service centers.

*Keywords:* Google maps, Internet, Location, Service


Intoduction
------------------
Every year, road traffic injuries cause more than 1.2 million deaths and have a profound effect on
health and development. It is the leading cause of death among young people between 15 and
29 years of age, and it costs governments about 3% of GDP. The global challenge of climate
change has been inadequately addressed despite its massive - and largely preventable - human
and economic toll.
Around 5 lakh road accidents occurred in India during the year 2010, resulting in the deaths of
134,513 people and the ill-treatment of more than 5 lakh persons. These numbers convert into 1
road accident each minute and 1 road accident death every four minutes. According to the
Reserve Bank of India, the absence of the Indian saving due to road accidents and fatalities likely
at 3% of GDP in 1999-2000 is mainly due to the fact that 53.1% of road accident victims were in
the age group of 25 to 65 years old in 2010, with pedestrians, bicyclists, and two-wheelers,
including the most unguarded road users, accounting for about 40% of all fatalities.


Motivation
------------------
Motivation is a critical aspect of any study as it sets the tone for the research and provides a basis for why the research is important. In the case of studying optimal route detection for combating road accidents, the following are some potential motivating factors:

**1. High incidence of road accidents:** Road accidents are a significant public health concern globally, with millions of people sustaining injuries and losing their lives every year. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 1.35 million people die each year as a result of road accidents, and tens of millions more are injured.

**2. Economic costs of road accidents:** Road accidents not only result in loss of life and injuries but also have significant economic costs. The WHO estimates that road accidents cost countries up to 3% of their GDP, which includes direct costs such as medical expenses and indirect costs such as lost productivity.

**3. Need for efficient emergency response:** Time is of the essence when it comes to responding to road accidents, and every second counts in saving lives. Therefore, it is crucial to have an efficient emergency response system that can quickly detect the location of an accident and dispatch emergency services to the scene.

**4. Advances in technology:** With advancements in technology, it is now possible to collect and analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and trends that can help in combating road accidents. For instance, data from GPS devices and sensors in vehicles can be used to detect road accidents and identify optimal routes for emergency response.

**5. Potential to save lives:** By detecting road accidents and identifying optimal routes for emergency response, it is possible to save lives and reduce the severity of injuries sustained in accidents. This is a significant motivation for studying optimal route detection for combating road accidents as it has the potential to make a real difference in people's lives.

Overall, the above-mentioned factors and many others provide strong motivation for studying optimal route detection for combating road accidents. Through this study, it is possible to develop more efficient emergency response systems that can save lives, reduce injuries, and minimize the economic costs associated with road accidents.

It develops an AI for the single player game using minimax and alpha- beta pruning algorithms. It has a very simplistic implementation of the Traffic sensing with not a lot of focus given on the AI.*|
|2|[Accident Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8816881)|2019|*The main goal is to integrate a system capable of detecting an accident from a video sequence fed to it by a camera. The goal is to detect a crash within seconds of it happening by using advanced deep learning algorithms that use complex neural networks (CNN or ConvNet) to analyze captured images from camera-generated video. They have focused on deploying this system on highways where traffic is less dense and timely help to those involved in an accident is rare. In this system,they have a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ Model which acts as a portable and remote computer to be set up on a CCTV camera. This model was then implemented on a Raspberry Pi using TensorFlow, OpenCV and Keras.*|
|3|[Traffic Density Measurement using Image Processing: An SVM approach](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281362311_Traffic_Density_Measurement_using_Image_Processing_An_SVM_approach) |2015|*Their system consists of 4 components- • Traffic management system • Road way system • MATLAB • SVM classifier algorithm V. So their proposed system needs the traffic management system, the roadway system. The CCTVs in the road will take the images of the current state of the traffic in roads. The images will be sent to be processed through server. Then the images will go through their proposed systems to detect the traffic density. The SVM classifier will be used to classify data. The process has three phases. First one is the image analysis part, second is the object detecting and counting part and the final part is the result representation using SVM classification algorithm.*|

It uses an user defined algorithm for accident detection which uses GPS location and Speed of car for recognizing the accident.*|
|5|[Mobile Web application for Automatic Accident Detection and Multimodal Alert](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7145935)|2020|*The proposed accident detection algorithm receives inputs from the vehicle, via ODB-II, and from the smartphone sensors, namely the accelerometer, the magnetometer and the gyroscope. The Android smartphone is also used as human machine interface, so that the driver can configure the application, receive road hazard warnings issued by other vehicles in the vicinity and cancel countdown procedures upon false accident detection.*|

Methodology
------------------

Machine  learning methods  showed  great success  at  anomaly detection. In  this study, we have considered incidents in normal traffic flow as an anomaly. When accident happens, following cars will slow down or stop, and many cars will be affected from accident. When location data of vehicles are analyzed , it is seen that many cars are collected around accident location. Clustering algorithms can be used to group vehicles according to their speed and location in particular road segment. In accident case, algorithms will put vehicles which is affected by accident in one group, other vehicles in other group or groups.  In our simulations , it has been observed that number of group is increased by 1 at the time of accident and number of vehicles in the new group increased in the following seconds. It can be interpreted as an accident happened and following cars or  cars around  the accident are affected by the accident.

## Data collection: 
The main data set we used for this project was a detailed accident record published by the UK government and hosted on Kaggle. This data set contains details about 1.6 million traffic accidents that took place in the UK between 2000 and 2014. It consists of 33 columns which capture details such as the location, time, severity of the accidents as well as various meteorological and traffic backdrops. In this project, we restricted ourselves to analyzing traffic accidents in Greater London between 2012 and 2014.
### Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/daveianhickey/2000-16-traffic-flow-england-scotland-wales/versions/8
The data belongs to a kaggle survey, we slected this datset because of its varied number of columns, prefrences and easy work flow.


1) *Sorting of data:*
The data that we aggregate from various resources needs to be sorted based on multiple factors, like the degree that needs to be completed before, or is a prerequisite for the other. This sorting of data can be done by making use of various algorithms like quick sort or merge sort, depending on which one is more efficient and time saving on our data.
2) *Data preprocessing:*
The obtained data from the workplace may not be large enough to represent a big dataset. We need to oversample the data in order to avoid skewing of the result. We try to achieve this by kMeans Smote and SVM Smote. This invludes fixing of null and NaN values for effective data analysis.
3) *Categorization of Data:*
The data needs to be categorized, into different streams. We categorize the users’ needs and the external data to ensure accurate mapping. We make use of clustering algorithms, like KNN clustering or BIRCH clustering method to put similar attributes under one category.
4) *Clustering of data:*
The data is clustered or grouped together with similar features to identify major accident factors for easy route detection. We try accomplishing this by using the KNN algorithm.
5) *Route Detection/Path prediction:*
Markov chaining provides various chains that can be followed, out of all these provided chains, the chain which is most suitable and shortest is chosen and displayed to the user. The choosing of the shortest chain is done with the help of bellman Ford algorithm, this algorithm will help us in finding the shortest path among the many paths which we get as output from the chaining process.
6) *Displaying output:*
Finally, after the optimal and shortest path is chosen, this path along with the relevant details needs to be displayed in an engaging way to the user, we can display this output in a website which can be integrated with the machine learning and dataset. We can integrate python code with website using flask, and the database can be integrated by making use of mongoDB and NodeJS. The front end of the website can be prepared with the help of ReactJS.
